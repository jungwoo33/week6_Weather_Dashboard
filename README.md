## 1. Title: week6_Weather_Dashboard
## 2. Project Description
I created the "Weather Outlook for Multiple Cities". Users can search any city in the USA, then the application will show the user the current and future (forecasting) weather condition for the city. When a user clicks on a city in the search history, then again the current and future conditions for that city will be shown. 

## 3. Application results:
