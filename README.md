## 1. Title: week6_Weather_Dashboard
## 2. Project Description
I created the "Weather Outlook for Multiple Cities". Users can search any city in the USA, then the application will show the user the current and future (forecasting) weather condition for the city. 
However, I couldn't finish the last criteria yet: "When click on a city in the search history, then I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city." I will finish this option after finishing the team project. 

## 3. Application results:
